# docker-gocd-agent-jdk

GoCD Agent docker image with JDK8 based on Alpine Linux.

## Notes
This is a slightly larger version of the image compared to [ashwanthkumar/gocd-agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/ashwanthkumar/gocd-agent/), but comes with a JDK compared the other image which only has JRE. You can run builds in a container based on this image.
